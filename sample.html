      {h4:: Description}
      {p::
        {strong::This} page is encoded in HyperText Object Notation.<br>
        Each object is converted into the HTML tag specified by the hton.js script at the end of this file.<br>
        If no tag is specified, then the object defaults to a div tag.
      }
      {p::
        Each HyperText Object has {strong::three} sections which correlate to the parts of an HTML tag:
        {ul::
          {li:: The first section is where the tag is specified. }
          {li:: The second is where the tag's attributes are enumerated.}
          {li:: The last section is where the tag's contents are enclosed.}
        }
        <script src="hton.js"></script> <!-- the hton.js script can be included almost anywhere in the HTML since it only executes once the window has loaded -->
        These three sections are separated by : colons.<br>
        Each HyperText Object is required to contain at least 2 colons, irrespective of whether a section is empty or not.<br>
        Colons in the attribute strings and in the last section will be ignored.
      }
      {h4::Notes}
      {ul::
        {li:: If desired, raw HTML can be directly included in the last section. }
        {li:: All HyperText Objects will receive a closing tag that matches the opening tag.}
        {li:: 
          In the last section, each occurrence of double brackets instead of single like {{{{ or }}}} 
          will not be converted to HTML but will instead be escaped with the double brackets becoming single brackets.
          Remember to separate adjacent closing brackets with a space of other character so that they are not interpreted as getting escaped. 
        }
      }
      {h4:: Implementation}
      {p:: 
        The hton.js script can be included anywhere in the page, and does not run until the window has finished loading.
      }
      {p::
        To get the script to convert the notation to html, simply place it in an html tag with the class="HTON".
      }
    }
